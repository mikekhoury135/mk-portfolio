              <br>
              <p>The <a href="https://www.mississaugahumanesociety.ca/">Mississauga Humane Society</a> is a local animal rescue in my hometown. Operating solely on
                  donations and volunteers, my classmates and I decided to redesign their website to
                  simplify the information architecture and address some graphic issues. 
              </p>    
              <p> 
                  We were limited in support we receieved from MHS due to us being unable to make contact with them. Regardless, we conducted
                  qualitative research and testing to determine the websites issues and ammend them.

      <h2>Research</h2>

    <div class="research-content">
      <p>Our research process was that of a standard redesign. We began by creating a proto-persona to outline
        the average MHS user. Our completed proto-persona reflected many common issues as well as objectives
         for our users.</p>

        </div>
      <p>After this, we set out to complete several evaluations. This includes redlining the site, a heuristic evaluation, colour accessibility evaluation,
        and a competitor analysis to see how the MHS stacks up around other humane societies in surrounding cities. Here are some examples.

      <div class="survey-interviews">
        <p>To gather data directly from users, we went ahead and made a survey to gain some basic insights such as what platform
          people would use to browse our website and so on.

        <p>The final and most qualitative data we gathered was our user interviews/tests. We brought on current and potential pet

        <h5>"MHS was initially designed for people to support pets in Mississauga that require sponsors, foster 
          homes and adoptive parents. We have observed that users like Hanna are routinely confused with the repetitive

          prototyping something the users might not even like. Here are some examples of the

        <p>While doing testing, we also worked on a style-tile that followed a similar path to that
          of the original website. Users were very receptive of the current colour palette so we decided
          to keep it. We did redesign a higher fidelity logo to compliment the colour scheme as the original
          website barely had one present. Some other notable parts of the style-guide was the shape and structure
          of the new and highly requested filtering system.

      <div class="mhs-midfi-prototype">
        <p>Now that we have 5-second test results and a completed style tile, we went straight ahead to
          mid-fidelity prototyping. This involved style-tile incorporation, but not all the MHS content 
          was available. This prototype was developed to test the new information architecture as well
          as if the reception of the style-tile was still positive.

        <div class="mhs-midfi-testing">
          <p>We managed to recruit four participants for testing of our prototype via zoom. We had 3 tasks
            for them to complete. Some of the insights we recieved were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure all parts of the navigation are clickable.</li>
            <li>Increase font size for readbility.</li>
            <li>Users located the necessary tools much faster than the original website.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="mhs-hifi-prototype">
        <p>With our mid-fidelty prototype having a mostly positive reception, we set out to make it
          hi-fidelity and responsive. This meant converting our design from the mobile form that it was
          in to a standard 1080p computer screen. We did not conduct user testing on this prototype due to 
          time constraints so no further iterations were made. We did however apply all feedback from the 
          last prototype so not much was changed other than the content. During the presentation of the case 
          study, the site had very positive reception and we did recieve some good qualitiatve feedback.
          I hope that one day, we will be able to do more iterations and actually implement this design to the 
          MHS website. Please click on the each of the respective images to view the completed prototype.

        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>There are many take aways for this school project. The first and most important one in
          my eyes is the fact that even a small website such as the Mississauga Humane Society can
          have so many miniscule issues that result in a very displesant user experience. Fortunately,
          many of these were easily identified in our user testing on both the original website and the
          prototype and were swiftly resolved. Aside from that, sometimes keeping it simple with the actual
          design is far more important than over reaching into the visual effects of the webpage. The
          redesign left users with more relevant information, better ways to help and overall less confusion.
          While we were not able to reach the MHS to implement our design, we will continue to contact them
          and I will update this case study if they allow us to do so.
